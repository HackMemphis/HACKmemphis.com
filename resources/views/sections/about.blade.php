                    HACKmemphis is an organization that hosts a weekend hackathon event. We encourage developers and designers of any background (or technology) to come together to work on whatever projects interest them. HACKmemphis is a free form weekend of hacking on software and hardware projects.

                <p>HACKmemphis is a mutual benefit nonprofit in the state of Tennessee. The
                    inaugural HACKmemphis Hackathon was September 14th &amp; 15th 2013. Our goal is to bring
                    together tech communities to develop hardware and software projects in Memphis. We are currently
                    planning our next event for September 19-21 2014. If you would be interested in volunteering or helping plan please
                    contact <a href="mailto:joe@hackmemphis.com">Joe</a>.
                </p>
                <p>HACKmemphis is organized by a group in Memphis comprised of developers, makers, hackers, and
                    local tech community supporters. We all want to see the local tech scene in Memphis thrive.
                    We are a mutual nonprofit organization. This is a nonprofit venture. All money raised goes
                    directly into creating the best event possible.
